# MeasurePi

A simple tool to help me keep track of where I am in a 'performance'. Displays bars, triplets, etc on a LaunchPad mini so I can hopefully time transitions a bit better.

## Raspberry Setup

I configured the Raspberry using the instructions Andrew Nicolaou wrote in his third Raspberry MIDI blog post: https://andrewnicolaou.co.uk/posts/2016/pi-zero-midi-3-two-things-at-once.
